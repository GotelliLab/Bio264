# Double For Loops
- traverse a matrix and operate on each element
- traverse a matrix with a constant operation
- constants for the rows
- constants for the columns

# Doing same things without loops
- vectorized call for operation on each element
- vectorized call for operation wtih constant
- loop through the rows
- loop through the columns

# Understanding mathematical equations
- variables (independent and dependent)
- constants (= parameters)

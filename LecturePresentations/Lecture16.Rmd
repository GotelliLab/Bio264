# Logit transformation
- p bounded between 0 and 1
- problem for a regression line
- $\mbox{odds ratio}(p) = \frac{p}{1-p}$
- bounded at $0,\infty$
- logit transformation = $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$
- bounded at $-\infty,\infty$
- intercept log odds ratio at x=0
- slope = change in log odds ratio with 1 unit change in x

# Analyzing logistic regression
- fit of model
- simple plot using predict function

# Getting data in and out of R
- create an Excel file, open with a text editor
- create a csv file in Excel, open with `read.csv`
- create an annotated text file, open with `read.table`
- show a real annotated text file from Czech group

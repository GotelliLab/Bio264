# For Loops

- var changes in loop
- set an explicit endpoint
- caution on sequence endpoints
- caution about initialization and variables outside loops
- always make the loop variable an integer
- still easy to operate on character strings

# Building a Random Walk Model Of Population Growth
- defining a few global variables
- bundling things into a function
- use the break function to get stop a loop prematurely 

# Double For Loops
- traverse a matrix and operate on each element
- traverse a matrix with a constant operation
- constants for the rows
- constants for the columns

# Doing same things without loops
- vectorized call for operation on each element
- vectorized call for operation wtih constant
- loop through the rows
- loop through the columns
